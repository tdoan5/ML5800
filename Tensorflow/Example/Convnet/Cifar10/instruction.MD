## Logistic Regression with TensorBoard

1. Log into Erdos:

`ssh username@erdos.dsm.fordham.edu`

2. Copy files on Erdos:

`cp -r /u/erdos/csga/doan/Public/tf/. ~/tfML5800/`

3. Run file tb_tf_logistic_Batch.ipynb by entering:

`cd ~/tfML5800`

`ipython3`

`run tf_tb_logistic_Batch.ipynb`

When done, hit `Ctrl + D` or enter `quit()` to exit.

4. Run the TensorBoard:

`tensorboard --logdir ~/tfML5800/graphs/logreg/BatchTest`

!!! Note: pay attention to the `port number` that tensorboard is taking

5. See the TensorBoard:

Use secure shell to see TensorBoad running on Erdos from your local computer/laptop:

`ssh -N -L 16006:localhost:6006 username@erdos.dsm.fordham.edu`

Enter your password. 

`Port default: 6006`

You should use whatever port instead of 6006 that the step 4 shows.

If it doesn't show any error, the tunnel is established succesfully. If you want to close the tunnel, hit `Ctrl + C`.

Next, open a browser in your computer/laptop and enter into the address bar:

`localhost:16006`

You will see the TensorBoard


## Run Cifar10 TensorFlow tutorial on Erdos

!Note: I removed the Cifar10 dataset from my Public folder so you may not able to run this tutorial on Erdos anymore.

I attached all files by email, so you can run them on your local computer or on the new MS Azure server.

If anyone want to see how it perform on Erdos with new GPU, you can go to my official hour, we can run it together.


1. Log into Erdos:

`ssh username@erdos.dsm.fordham.edu`

Enter your password.

2. On Erdos, copy necessary files:

`cp -r /u/erdos/csga/doan/Public/cifar10/. ~/tfconvnet/`

this command creates a folder named `tfconvnet` in your home directory, and copy all necessary files into that.

3. In the Terminal, run: 

`python3 ~/tfconvnet/cifar10_train.py`

It will read cifar10 data from my Public folder `/u/erdos/csga/doan/Public/cifar10_data`.

It will save training checkpoint logs to `~/cifar10_train` on your Erdos account.

4. In the 2nd terminal, run:

`python3 ~/tfconvnet/cifar10_eval.py`

It will save checkpoint logs at `~/cifar10_eval` on your Erdos account.

We can see that the total lost decreases and the precision increases when training in 2 different terminals.

5. `Optional`, if you want to see in TensorBoard how the lost and the precision update lively over the training time.

Open a new terminal to log into Erdos:

`tensorboard --logdir "training":~/cifar10_train,"evaluation":~/cifar10_eval`

If you run the example on `your own computer`, try:

`tensorboard --logdir "training":/tmp/cifar10_train,"evaluation":/tmp/cifar10_eval`

To see only how the lost updates when training:

`tensorboard --logdir ~/cifar10_train`

Or you want to see only how the precision updates:

`tensorboard --logdir ~/cifar10_eval`

`Note`: 

!!! Remember if you want to quit TensorBoard, hit `Ctrl + C`.


6. `Optional`, only if you do run the step 3.

Use secure shell to see TensorBoad running on Erdos from your local computer/laptop:

`ssh -N -L 16006:localhost:6006 username@erdos.dsm.fordham.edu`

Enter your password. 

If it doesn't show any error, the tunnel is established succesfully. If you want to close the tunnel, hit `Ctrl + C`.

Next, open a browser in your computer/laptop and enter into the address bar:

`localhost:16006`

You will see the TensorBoard

`Note:`

!!! Remember to close the tunnel and release the port 16006 when you complete, hit `Ctrl + C`.

Otherwise, if you run the step 6 again, it may shows error that the port is already used.

7. `Note`:

If you want to see Tensorboad, you have to do both steps 5 and 6. 

You can perform either of step 5 or 6 first, it doesn't matter.
